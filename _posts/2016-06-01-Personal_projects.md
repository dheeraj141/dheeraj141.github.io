  <h4>DRAM Solutions</h4>
</div>
<div class="project_description">
  <p><b> Understood and programmed (hardware memory tester) in C languages for DRAM testing resulting in 50% less testing time</b>.</p>
</div>
<div class="Project_details">
  <ul>
    <li><p> Understood CPGC ( hardware memory tester which can be programmed using software) and implemented algorithms (in C language) such as March X, March Y to test DRAM using it.</p></li>
    <li>Resulted in 50% faster memory testing as compared to system level testing.</p></li>
    </ul>
</div>

  <h4>Analyze Mobile Payment Apps</h4>
</div>
<div class="project_description">
  <p> <b> Analyzed a bunch of mobile payment apps for security vulnerabilities concentrated on communication protocols, Authentication and cryptographic implementation).</b></p>
</div>
<div class ="Project_details">
  <ul>
    <li><p>Employed mallodroid and qualys SSL server test to find broken SSL certificates.</p></li>
    <li><p> Manual analysis of the app done to gain a more thorough understanding of app functionality, data flows , permission and information leakage.</p></li>
  </ul>
</div>



<div class="project_heading">
  <h4> Row Hammering</h4>
</div>
<div class="project_description">
  <b>Exploiting Row Hammering Vulnerability to compromise the system.</b>
</div>
<div class ="Project_details">
  <ul>
    <li>Row Hammering vulnerability in DDR4/DDR3 was used to manipulate the OS page tables.</li>
    <li> Resulted in gaining access to the whole physical memory.</li>

  <h4> IO-Margin</h4>
</div>
<div class="project_description">
  <b>Designed and developed software to select parameters which results in optimal performance of DRAM (DDR4).</b>
</div>
<div class="Project_details">
  <ul>

  <li><p>This project included determining the performance of each timing parameter on the DRAM performance (latency, ISI, cross-talks, data-rate) and to set the best case of parameters for maximal performance based on eye diagram.</p></li>
  </ul>
